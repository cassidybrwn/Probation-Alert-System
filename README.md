The Academic Probation Alert System specifically tracks students' academic performance, allowing administrative personnel to input data, record grades, calculate GPAs, and 
send alerts to both students and faculty as needed. 
Additionally, it facilitates the computation of cumulative GPAs and provides a mechanism for staff to adjust the default GPA threshold for alerts.
